# Exercise 3 - Styling Tips

Styling visualizations and dashboards is not just for aesthetics, it's for _communication_. Clearly assembled visualizations help communicate data insights to your audience, which is the core purpose of data visualization.

The topic itself is quite broad by nature, but I have compiled some Spotfire resources here for you to reference and an exercise to follow along with. We will go over these during the live Bootcamp session. (If you are participating in the Data Visualization Competition, this topic is very important!!)
