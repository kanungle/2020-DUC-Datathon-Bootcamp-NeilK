# DUC Datathon Bootcamp with TIBCO Spotfire

Welcome to the DUC Datathon 2020 Intermediate Level Bootcamp for TIBCO Spotfire :bar_chart:! Follow along with this guide to learn about geoanalytics, data functions, machine learning, visualization best practices, and more.



### Introduction

Hi! My name is Neil Kanungo and I'm a Data Scientist with TIBCO Software. You might know me from [Dr. Spotfire](https://community.tibco.com/wiki/doctor-spotfire-office-hours) :grin:! If you haven't heard of Dr. Spotfire, I highly recommend you subscribe to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx3agqDZLbfrHNDUaxr0CXA) to get regular Spotfire video tips, and [register](https://www.tibco.com/events/dr-spotfire-office-hours) for one of our monthly live sessions. There's always tons to learn with TIBCO Spotfire and I aim to teach you all the newest tricks :cowboy_hat_face:

The bootcamp in this repo covers three (3) exercises to help intermediate users:

- [Exercise 1 : Geospatial Analysis](https://github.com/kanungle/2020-DUC-Datathon-Bootcamp-NeilK/tree/master/Exercise%201%20-%20Geospatial%20Analysis)
- [Exercise 2 : Regression Analysis](https://github.com/kanungle/2020-DUC-Datathon-Bootcamp-NeilK/tree/master/Exercise%202%20-%20Regression%20Analysis)
- [Exercise 3 : Styling Tips](https://github.com/kanungle/2020-DUC-Datathon-Bootcamp-NeilK/tree/master/Exercise%203%20-%20Styling%20Tips)

You can find the files for each exercise in separate folders of this directory, or simply linked here.



### Exercise 1: Geospatial Analysis

![Overview](https://github.com/kanungle/2020-DUC-Datathon-Bootcamp-NeilK/blob/master/images/Ex%201%20-%20Overview.png)

Using sophisticated Machine Learning and Geospatial Analysis can be easy in Spotfire! In this thorough exercise, you will learn how to spatially interpolate values, generalize values with contours, cluster with unsupervised machine learning, merge points and geometries, and determine important variables.

### Exercise 2: Regression Analysis

TIBCO Spotifre has many tools to help you with Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis right out of the box :package:! In this quick example, you'll walk through some basic Well Production Data for the Bakken Formation, and determine the top predictors for best production without writing any code.

### Exercise 3: Styling Tips

![Overview](https://github.com/kanungle/2020-DUC-Datathon-Bootcamp-NeilK/blob/master/images/Ex3%20-%20Color%20Guidance.png)

Styling visualizations and dashboards is not just for aesthetics, it's for _communication_. Clearly assembled visualizations help communicate data insights to your audience, which is the core purpose of data visualization.

The topic itself is quite broad by nature, but I have compiled some Spotfire resources here for you to reference and an exercise to follow along with. We will go over these during the live Bootcamp session. (If you are participating in the Data Visualization Competition, this topic is very important!!)
